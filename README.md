*Sample data visualization created using the provided Google Apps Script functions.*

The repository contains two script files, `updateCharts.gs` and `updateTable.gs`, both of which work together to update charts and tables in the Google Sheets Dashboard. Additionally, a sample spreadsheet file, `sample_spreadsheet.xlsx`, is provided to demonstrate the implementation and usage of the scripts. This sample file contains example data and code, making it easier for you to test the project quickly.

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to simplify the process of creating interactive data visualizations in Google Sheets. By using these GAS functions, users can dynamically update charts and tables based on the provided data, allowing for easy and efficient analysis and decision-making.

## Key Features

- Interactive data visualization using Google Sheets
- Automatic updating of charts and tables based on data changes
- Customizable chart and table elements
- Easy integration with existing Google Sheets projects

## Installation Steps

1. Create a new Google Sheet or open an existing one.
2. Click on "Extensions" in the menu, then select "Apps Script."
3. In the Apps Script editor, create two new script files named `updateCharts.gs` and `updateTable.gs`.
4. Copy the contents of `updateCharts.gs` and `updateTable.gs` from this repository into the corresponding files in the Apps Script editor.
5. Save the changes in the Apps Script editor and close it.
6. Import the sample data from the `sample_spreadsheet.xlsx` file into your Google Sheet.

## Usage

1. After setting up the scripts, you can create a new chart by selecting a range of data in your Google Sheet and clicking "Insert" > "Chart."
2. Customize your chart as desired, then move it to the "Dashboard" sheet.
3. Run the `updateCharts` function from the Apps Script editor to update all the charts in the "Dashboard" sheet.
4. Run the `updateTable` function from the Apps Script editor to update the table in the "Dashboard" sheet.

## Dependencies

This project relies on Google Apps Script, a scripting platform developed by Google for light-weight application development in the Google Workspace ecosystem. Additionally, the project is supported by GPT-4, a powerful AI language model developed by OpenAI.
